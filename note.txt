2. Enable TPM in BIOS/UEFI
Access BIOS/UEFI:
Restart your PC and press the key to enter BIOS/UEFI (e.g., F2, Del, F10, or Esc, depending on the manufacturer).

Alternatively, go to Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Restart now under Advanced startup, then select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware Settings.

Enable TPM:
Navigate to the Security or Trusted Computing section.

Look for TPM, TPM 2.0 Security, Intel PTT, or AMD fTPM and set it to Enabled.

Ensure Secure Boot is enabled and the system is in UEFI mode (not Legacy) under the Boot menu.

Save changes (usually F10) and reboot.

Verify After Reboot:
Reopen tpm.msc to confirm TPM is now detected and ready.

3. Update TPM Drivers and Firmware
Check Device Manager:
Press Win + X, select Device Manager, and expand Security Devices.

Right-click Trusted Platform Module and select Update driver > Search automatically for drivers.

If a yellow triangle appears, select Troubleshoot or reinstall the driver.

Update Firmware:
Visit your device manufacturer’s support site (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo) and download the latest TPM firmware update for your model.

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to apply the update, as TPM firmware issues can prevent Windows Hello from using the TPM.

4. Clear TPM (if Necessary)
If TPM is detected but not used (e.g., ownership issues or previous configuration):
In tpm.msc, select Action > Clear TPM.

Warning: Clearing the TPM may affect BitLocker or other TPM-protected data. Back up encryption keys (e.g., BitLocker recovery key) before proceeding.

Follow the prompts, which may require a restart.

After reboot, reinitialize the TPM if prompted by Windows.

5. Reset Windows Hello Keys
Since the current keys are software-based, reset Windows Hello to force TPM usage:
Open Command Prompt as the user.

Run: certutil -DeleteHelloContainer.

This deletes existing Windows Hello keys (you may need to re-authenticate for apps like 1Password).

Go to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options and set up Windows Hello again (PIN, face, or fingerprint).

Re-run certutil -csp "Microsoft Passport Key Storage Provider" -key -v to confirm NgcKeyImplType is now 1 (NCRYPT_IMPL_HARDWARE_FLAG).

6. Enforce TPM Usage via Group Policy
Your earlier message indicated that policies like Turn on PIN sign-in are Not Configured, which allows software fallback. To require TPM:
Open Group Policy Editor (Win + R > gpedit.msc).

Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Hello for Business.

Set Use Windows Hello for Business to Enabled.

Set Use a hardware security device to Enabled to prevent software fallback.

Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Logon.

Ensure Turn on PIN sign-in is Enabled or Not Configured.

Run gpupdate /force in Command Prompt to apply changes.

If in a domain environment, contact your IT administrator, as domain policies may override local settings.

7. Verify Registry Settings (Optional)
If Group Policy is unavailable (e.g., Windows 10 Home) or to confirm settings:
Open Registry Editor (Win + R > regedit).

Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Protect\Providers\df9d8cd0-1501-11d1-8c7a-00c04fc297eb.

Ensure the DWORD RequireHardware is set to 1 (or create it if missing). If set to 0 or absent, software fallback is allowed.

Caution: Back up the registry before making changes.

8. Test Windows Hello
Lock your PC (Win + L) and sign in using Windows Hello (PIN, face, or fingerprint).

If it works without falling back to a password (except after a reboot, which is normal), and NgcKeyImplType is 1, TPM policies are properly set.

If it fails or NgcKeyImplType remains 2, revisit TPM status, drivers, or policies.

If Your Device Lacks a TPM
Check Hardware:
If tpm.msc shows no TPM and BIOS/UEFI has no TPM options, your device may not have a TPM chip or firmware TPM (Intel PTT/AMD fTPM).

Run Get-Tpm in PowerShell to confirm (TpmPresent: False indicates no TPM).

Implications:
Windows 10 allows Windows Hello with software-based storage (NgcKeyImplType: 2), as seen in your output. This is less secure, as keys are stored in the Windows Credential Manager rather than a hardware-isolated TPM.

For maximum security, consider upgrading to a device with TPM 2.0 or enabling firmware TPM if your CPU supports it (e.g., Intel 7th Gen+ for PTT, AMD Ryzen for fTPM).

Workaround:
If no TPM is available, ensure your PIN is complex (not all digits) to mitigate risks of software-based storage. Microsoft notes that software-based PINs can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

Additional Troubleshooting
Check Event Viewer:
Open Win + X > Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System or Application.

Look for TPM or Windows Hello errors (e.g., Event IDs related to TPM or Ngc).

Update Windows:
Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and install all updates, as TPM or Windows Hello bugs may be fixed in newer builds.

Manufacturer Support:
If TPM is present but not working, check your device manufacturer’s support site for BIOS/UEFI updates or TPM-specific troubleshooting.

Domain Environment:
If managed by an organization, domain policies may prevent TPM usage or enforce software fallback. Consult your IT administrator.

Summary
The NgcKeyImplType: 2 indicates Windows Hello is using software-based storage, not TPM, which is less secure. To fix this:
Confirm TPM is enabled in BIOS/UEFI and ready in tpm.msc.

Update TPM drivers/firmware.

Reset Windows Hello keys with certutil -DeleteHelloContainer and reconfigure.

Enforce TPM usage via Group Policy (Use a hardware security device set to Enabled).

Verify NgcKeyImplType is 1 after reconfiguration.
If no TPM is present, Windows Hello will continue using software storage, and you may need to upgrade hardware for TPM support. Test sign-in to ensure functionality, and contact your device manufacturer or IT administrator if issues persist.

Note: Assumes Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise. For Windows 10 Home, skip Group Policy steps but follow TPM and Windows Hello checks.
